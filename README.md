# hybridBFS using OpenMP and MPI
Breadth-First Search is a very famous algorithm used in many applications such as Peer to Peer Networks and Social Networking Websites.
So decided to parallelize it using hybrid programming, i.e., OpenMP and MPI. 
Took help from Link: http://web.mit.edu/neboat/www/presentations/spaa2010.pdf
Some samples graphs in sparse and dense formats are given in the sample folder.
Comparison between sequential, top-down, and bottom-up approaches with our implementation is taken as output.
This code is checked for up to 100000 edges, and it is working fine.
Memory complexity is low
